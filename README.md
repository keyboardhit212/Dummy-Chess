# Dummy-Chess

Dummy Chess is a console based game that simulates the movement of each chess pieces.

## Instructions

The mode of the game is simple. There are 2 players the Black and the White Player. Each turn a certain player has to move a piece until such time that the King of a specific player is defeated.

There are 2 play modes for this game namely: Player against Himself and Player against a Pseudo AI (Not yet Implemented).

## Explanation

You might be wondering why this project is called Dummy Chess instead of just plainly naming it as "Chess". That's because I was initially planning on it having AI, however I am not familiar to the concepts and principles of implementing one. So The "AI" of this project is based on pseudo random choices and not heuristics.

## How to run

A jar file is provided to simplify the execution of this program for those who are not very familiar of Java or to those who are just starting out. You can execute it using the CLI (make sure that java is added into the PATH) with: 

**java -jar jarfile.jar**

However, you can just compile the project itself if you are familiar with the process of compiling and executing one since the jar file itself could be outdated.
