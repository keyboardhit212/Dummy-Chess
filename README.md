# Dummy-Chess

Dummy Chess is a console based game that simulates the movement of each chess pieces.

## Instructions

The mode of the game is simple. There are 2 players the Black and the White Player. Each turn a certain player has to move a piece until such time that the King of a specific player is defeated.

There are 2 play modes for this game namely: Player against Himself and Player against a Pseudo AI (Not yet Implemented).

## Explanation

You might be wondering why this project is called Dummy Chess instead of just plainly naming it as "Chess". That's because I was initially planning on it having AI, however I am not familiar to the concepts and principles of implementing one. So The "AI" of this project is based on pseudo random choices and not heuristics.
